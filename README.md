## Instructions on running code

Before running code, hw04_dataset.mat must be in the same folder as the script.

Type in `python ds4400_hossain_script.py`

This should be python 3 so if default is python 2, then use python3 instead of python

Outputs:

Running the code will output all the weights and biases of the model for all layers

This will take up a lot of space

The next output will be all the outputs from the activation layer

The next output will be the training accuracy which will be a decimal representing a probability

The next output will be the testing accuracy which will be a decimal representing a probability

### Question 1 Answer:

The data is not linearly separable 

Here is the reported information along with the labeled graphs in the folder

Note that all of these are using ReLu as the activation function for hidden layers
with a Sigmoid as the final classification layer

Note that all Neural Networks were training for 50 epochs.

### One hidden layer 10 neurons

Training Accuracy: .982
Testing Accuracy: .98

### One hidden layer 30 neurons

Training Accuracy: .996
Testing Accuracy: .993

### One hidden layer 50 neurons

Training Accuracy: 1.0
Testing Accuracy: 1.0

### Two hidden layers 10 neurons

Training Accuracy: 1.0
Testing Accuracy: 1.0

### Two hidden layers 30 neurons

Training Accuracy: 1.0
Testing Accuracy: 1.0

### Two hidden layers 50 neurons

Training Accuracy: 1.0
Testing Accuracy: 1.0
